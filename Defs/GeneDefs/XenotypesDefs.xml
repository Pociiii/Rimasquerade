        <description>The Judges of the Banu Haqim are torn between their hereditary thirst for vampiric Blood and their passion for justice. Stern adjudicators, they are fiercely devoted to upholding a moral code, and Embrace mortals capable of assessing and handling threats, enforcing laws and traditions, and punishing transgressors.</description>
        <descriptionShort>Judges of transgression, intellectuals and lawyers, assassins and blood sorcerers; once known as Assamites, the Children of Haqim have recently joined the ranks of the Camarilla.</descriptionShort>

        <description>Often closer to beasts than other vampires, and so the Gangrel style themselves apex predators. These Ferals prowl the wilds as easily as the urban jungle, and no clan of vampires can match their ability to endure, survive, and thrive in any environment. Often fiercely territorial, their shapeshifting abilities even give the undead pause.</description>

        <description>A motley collection of necromantic vampire bloodlines, the Hecata clan are united in the pursuit of a single subject: Death. They are students of the afterlife and resurrectionists of the dead — or worse. Selling their services to the highest bidder, or acting in their own interests, there are few who can hide from the surveillance of those who can summon and command the very spirits of the deceased.</description>
        <descriptionShort>Necromancers, Graverobbers, Lazarenes. The Hecata are as much a Family as they are a Clan; the only true Independents in these nights, the separate Clans of Death, including the Giovanni, Cappadocians, Samedi and others have now united as the Hecata. For them, the Family is everything; and if you are not one of them, you will never know how deep the Blood runs.</descriptionShort>

        <description>Creatures subtly at odds with mundane reality, Lasombra vampires are expected to triumph at any cost. Ruthlessness is a sought-after trait in progeny, making their reputation as betraying interlopers well deserved. Most do not seek attention, preferring to act as puppeteers, powers behind the proverbial throne. To a Shadow, the ends justify any means.</description>
        <descriptionShort>Winners at life, religious figures, manipulative shadow masters, social climbers, ruthless fighters; once a pillar of the Sabbat, they’ve now begun defecting to the ranks of the Camarilla. </descriptionShort>

        <description>Derided as Lunatics by other vampires, the Blood of the Malkavians lets them perceive and foretell truths hidden from others. Like the “wise madmen” of poetry their fractured perspective stems from seeing too much of the world at once, from understanding too deeply, and feeling emotions that are just too strong to bear.</description>

They Embrace those with the will and means to sway, entrap, and ultimately liberate their targets from whatever they seek: the victim’s possessions, allegiance, or even faith. To the Serpents, everything has a price.</description>
        <descriptionShort>The rebranded Followers of Set, refused admission by the Camarilla and welcomed among the Anarchs. Both liars and liberators, seekers of freedom from chains through pain, pleasure, and any other means, occult cultists and preachers, standing between refusal of social norms and true depravity. </descriptionShort>

Their bodies horribly twisted and deformed through the Embrace, they lurk on the fringes of most cities, acting as spies and brokers of information. Using animals and their own supernatural capacity to hide, nothing escapes the eyes of the so-called Sewer Rats.</description>

Always on the move, the Ravnos can never rest in the same place for long lest their curse light them on fire as they slumber.</description>

        <description>Their legacy is one of tragedy and a painful lesson of the eternal struggle. Their childer are few in the modern nights; as per their customs, they generally only embrace once they've reached Golconda, even though this is only speculation given the current state of Kindred affairs. The choice of a childe for the Salubri is an intensely personal decision in comparison to other clans. They usually desire those with inquisitive behaviors and personal struggles within them. Salubri rarely embrace on a mere whim. Choosing a childe who has a problem which they must then solve for themselves, be it terminal illness or an unquenchable drive to right a wrong done to them.</description>
        <descriptionShort>Few exist in the modern nights; unlike other clans they are not embraced on a whim. They instead are carefully chosen by their sire to complete a task through their inquisitive nature, nigh-pious with the tenacity to survive through difficulties. </descriptionShort>

As vampires, they’ve perfected ways to bend their own Blood to their will, employing their sorceries to master and ensorcel both the mortal and vampire world. Their power makes them valuable, but few vampires trust their scheming ways.</description>

        <description>The dragons view ownership above all, they aim to conquer and rule the subject of their possessiveness. Traditionally their charges were based on geographical locations, hence the stereotype of a vampire in a looming castle. However, in the modern age, the younger generations have taken a more loose approach, staking claim over mortals rather than their land. Their desire to own is only limited by their lack of expansion, but once they've sunk their claws in they are hard to shake loose.</description>
        <descriptionShort>The Dragons of Kindred, this clan embraces to own. They do not care if their charges live well, but aim simply to control. Those who are loyal to the Tzimisce are often so more out of fear than love. </descriptionShort>

Considered little more than trash by most vampires, the thin-bloods are banding together, leveraging their resistance to sunlight and the strange, mercurial adaptability of their powers against their oppressors.</description>
        <descriptionShort>With the thickness of vitae dwindling, the Duskborn are too far removed from Caine to share his curse or reap the full benefits of vampirism.
